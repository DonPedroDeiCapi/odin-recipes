    <h2><strong>What is Hummus?</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Hummus is an Al Al-Moraccan dip made by blending chickpeas with tahini, garlic, and 
        lemon. Use hummus as a spread on your favorite sandwiches/pita wraps, use it as a dip 
        for your favorite vegetables or crackers. You can even use it as a base for your favorite meals.

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tahini</li>
        <li>Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Sea Salt</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Sumac or ground cumin for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak and Cook Chickpeas: </strong>
            Place 1 cup dried chickpeas in a large bowl and cover 
            with plenty of water (the beans will expand.) Soak overnight. When ready, drain the chickpeas 
            and place them in a medium-sized heavy cooking pot. Cover with water by about 2 inches. Bring 
            to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. You should end up with about 3 cups 
            of cooked chickpeas.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Peel the chickpeas: </strong>
            Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. 
            Take a handful of chickpeas and rub them under running water to remove the skins. Discard skins. Let 
            the chickpeas cool completely before using. Reserve 1 to 2 tablespoons of chickpeas to garnish the 
            finished hummus later.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Puree the chickpeas: </strong>
            Dry the chickpeas well then add them to the bowl of a large food processor fitted with the S-blade. Run 
            the processor until the chickpeas turn into a smooth powder-like paste.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish the hummus: </strong>
            While the food processor is running, add 2 ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 to 5 
            minutes. Check, and if the consistency is too thick, run the processor and slowly add a little water. Blend 
            until you reach the desired silky-smooth consistency. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the hummus 
            for an hour or so before serving.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish: </strong>
            Spread the hummus in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil. Add the reserved 
            chickpeas to the middle, if youâ€™d like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges, your favorite veggies, 
            and some warm pita bread.
        </li>
